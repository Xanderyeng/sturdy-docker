# Docker for WordPress
This is a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) based local environment for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) Development

## Prerequisite
Before you begin using Docker for WordPress, I like to point out a few things. Docker for WordPress currently works with Linux and macOS with the latest Docker for Mac and Docker CE for Linux which also comes with other software needed. The main piece of software that you will need since shyaml which is a tool that allows specific files to read and generate automation throughout the this project. Without shyaml, the automation will not work well and may not able to get it working.
